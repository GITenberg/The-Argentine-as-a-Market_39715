<p class="center">THE GARTSIDE REPORTS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Gartside Reports are the reports made by the
Gartside Scholars at the University of Manchester. The
Gartside Scholarships were established in 1902 for a
limited period, by John Henry Gartside, Esq., of
Manchester. They are tenable for two years and about
three are awarded each year. They are open to males
of British nationality who at the date of the election
shall be over the age of eighteen years and under the age
of twenty-three years.</p>

<p>Every scholar must enter the University of Manchester
for one Session for a course of study approved by the
electors. The remainder of the time covered by the
Scholarship must be devoted to the examination of
subjects bearing upon Commerce or Industry in Germany
or Switzerland, or in the United States of America, or
partly in one of the above-mentioned countries and partly
in others, but the electors may on special grounds allow
part of this period of the tenure of the Scholarship to be
spent in study and travel in some other country or
countries. It is intended that each scholar shall select
some industry, or part of an industry, or some business,
for examination, and investigate this comparatively in
the United Kingdom and abroad. The first year&rsquo;s work
at the University of Manchester is designed to prepare
the student for this investigation, and it partly takes the
form of directed study, from publications and by direct
investigation, of English conditions with regard to the
industrial or commercial subjects upon which research
will be made abroad in the second year of the scholarship.
Finally, each scholar must present a report, which will
as a rule be published.</p>

<p>The value of a Scholarship is about &pound;80 a year for the
time spent in England, &pound;150 a year for time spent on
the Continent of Europe, and about &pound;250 a year for
time spent in America.</p>

<span class="ltrspc">THE ECONOMIC BASIS OF THE ARGENTINE.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first thing that strikes the new arrival in the
Argentine, and the last thing that he is likely to forget
when he leaves the country, is the extraordinary inflation
of prices. With the exception of meat, and perhaps
bread, there is no article of common consumption which
does not cost considerably more than in England, every
allowance being made for freight and tariff charges.
The reason for this excess is doubtless to be found in the
concentration of trade in the capital. All imports, for
reasons that will be dealt with later, pass through the
hands of the large houses in Buenos Aires, who act as
sole agents for the whole of the Republic north of the
Rio Negro. [While, owing to the precarious nature of
all business, dependent entirely on the grain and cattle
yield, much higher prices are charged in fat years than
would be justified if these times of prosperity were
regarded as permanent.] Because of this concentration
of business in the capital, and in the centre of the town
in particular, rents have risen to an immense extent,
greatly increasing all establishment charges, and in turn
the price of commodities sold&mdash;a cause which acts again
of course in retail trade and neutralises the freight charges
to outlying districts. But the essential fact in Argentine
Economics, and one which seems more than obvious,
but apparently escapes the comprehension of Argentine
legislators, is that the country is naturally, and must
remain for some considerable time, a producer of raw
material exclusively. The country is still considerably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">-&nbsp;2&nbsp;-</a></span>
under-populated for the development of its natural
resources, while only a small portion of the settled area
is yet producing even half the yield of which it is
immediately capable. Immigration of a certain class&mdash;capable
agriculturalists with some capital&mdash;is still
required. But with a strange perversity politicians have
persistently advocated a high protective tariff for the
purpose of fostering industrial development. The result
has been that certain industries have cropped up under
this system, which are quite incapable of independent
existence, and, while satisfying neither the employers
nor their men, constitute a very heavy drain on the
national purse. The chief objection, however, to the
policy is that it invites a class of immigrant who is really
not required in the country and who has taken to settling
in the capital instead of scattering into the camp.</p>

<p>The immigrant required is the &ldquo;colonist,&rdquo; to whom
the country is already beginning to owe much of its
prosperity. There are two distinct types of colonist&mdash;the
one who buys his land on a permanent colony, and
builds a decent house, and the temporary tenant whose
economic principle is to break the soil of new land, and
moves to a new district at the end of his term. The
latter owes his origin to the cultivation of &ldquo;alfalfa,&rdquo; <a name="thethe" id="thethe"></a>the
wonderful clove-like plant that will grow on sand,
and requires no rain, but thrives on the surface water
which abounds in the country&rsquo;s flat, low-lying plains.
Alfalfa will not grow in hard unbroken ground, and
where the land is such, cereal cultivation is necessary for
three years to reduce it to a fit condition. This work
requires labour which is not available among the
gauchos, the horsemen who act as hands on the estancias,
and the estanciero himself probably does not possess the
knowledge requisite for the cultivation of grain. A
contract is therefore made with colonists, usually
Piedmontese or Basques, to break the soil and grow
cereals for three, or more usually five, years, either at a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">-&nbsp;3&nbsp;-</a></span>
fixed rent or for a percentage of the crop, the stipulation
being that with the last year&rsquo;s seed alfalfa is sown as
well. When the last crop has been cut, the latter grows
through the stubble. The growth of this plant is such
that as alfalfa is more cultivated, the stock-bearing
capacities of the country will easily be trebled.</p>

<p>The main supports of the country are, therefore, cereals
and cattle, the latter being undoubtedly the more
profitable investment, but requiring a much larger
capital. By Argentine, as by French, law property at
death is compulsorily divided, and this tends to split up
the now immense tracts of land occupied by individuals.
Whatever the social advantages of such a system may
be, it is not conducive to the most economic working,
nor yet to the breeding of the finest strains of stock, for
which a large capital is required. A form of evasion,
however, has been found in the formation of limited
liability companies, often private, to run big estancias.
These have everything to recommend them from the
economic point of view. A capable manager is put in
charge of the work on the spot, and, as capital is usually
forthcoming, the estancias are run in such a way as to
yield the greatest possible return. They are usually
well-maintained, up-to-date in management and fittings,
and supplied with good home-bred strains.</p>

<p>There are, however, other natural sources of wealth in
the Argentine; notably, the forests of hard-woods (of the
acacia order) which abound in the Chaco, in Corrientes
and Entre Rios, and are also found in the province of
C&oacute;rdoba and elsewhere; the sugar industry in the north-west
(of which more will be said under &ldquo;<a href="#sugar">The Tariffs</a>&rdquo;);
the hitherto undeveloped fruit cultivation in all parts of
the country (this in the sub-tropical and central provinces
would be especially liable to suffer from the depredations
of locusts); perhaps, too, cotton growing in the Chaco,
where, however, the supply of labour is much questioned,
and some pests peculiar to the cotton-bole are reported<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">-&nbsp;4&nbsp;-</a></span>
as existing; and, lastly, the minerals, as yet wholly
undeveloped. Although these are undoubtedly much
more scarce than in Bolivia and Chile, the absence of an
impartial geological survey has rendered the flotation of
bogus companies easy, and practically prevented any
genuine development, in spite of their greater accessibility
than in the former country. The recent boom and
collapse in gold ventures was the result of stock exchange
transactions, probably fraudulent, as, with the exception
of the sea-bed to the very south of the country (where
it cannot be recovered), gold is probably one of the few
minerals which does not exist to a workable extent.</p>

<p>A curious feature in the Argentine is the absence of
navigable rivers. With the exception of the treacherous
<a name="Parana" id="Parana"></a>Paran&aacute; and the Uruguay, enclosing the provinces of
Entre Rios and Corrientes, there is not a single waterway,
natural or artificial. The result of this has been an
enormous network of railways spreading over the central
provinces with isolated offshoots north and west. The
consequent great influx of capital would naturally have
encouraged a large import trade; but the prohibitive tariff
has succeeded in retaining the money in the country,
while the revenue derived has, almost without exception,
been uneconomically employed. The result is that, apart
from an occasional monopoly that has succeeded, the
only large gainers from this policy have been the town
property holders.</p>

<p>A large part, however, of the province of Buenos Aires
is liable to periodic inundation, and, to obviate this, an
extensive system of drainage has been planned, a work of
great difficulty owing to the small difference of altitude
between the land and the sea. Some canals, however,
are in course of construction of which advantage might
possibly be taken, if they were made of sufficient depth,
for local transport. If this were done, a large and
important part of the country would be provided with a
cheaper alternative to the railway. In a volume<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">-&nbsp;5&nbsp;-</a></span>
descriptive of the Republic (published, in English, by
the Department of Agriculture) this possibility is foreshadowed,
stress being laid on the slight fall from the
Andes to the coast, and a scheme, chimerical on the face
of it, of a system of trans-continental canals is vaguely
outlined. But, being so wildly improbable, it seems to
have no existence, even problematical, outside the pages
of that advertisement.</p>

<a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a><br /><br />
<span class="ltrspc">THE RAILWAYS.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> prosperity of the Argentine Republic would
undoubtedly have been impossible without the enormous
investments made by British financial houses in its
railway development. For many years&mdash;in fact, until
quite recently&mdash;the influx of capital was welcomed and
encouraged. Concessions were lavished on anyone
ready to take them up, and, far from irksome conditions
being imposed, valuable privileges were granted
to the <i>concessionnaires</i>. Moreover, the national and
provincial governments were only too eager to get rid
of such lines as they themselves owned, and invariably
worked at a loss, and to transfer them to European
concerns. That the railways were financed from motives
of promiscuous philanthropy is improbable, but that the
English financiers were almost alone in their confidence
in the future of the country is not only true, but it is a
truth which the most respected and able Argentines fully
realise. There exists, however, at the present moment
a very powerful feeling of opposition to the &ldquo;Empresas,&rdquo;
as they are called&mdash;the &ldquo;concerns&rdquo; that practically
control the country&mdash;and (so say their opponents) exploit
it entirely for their own ends. Apart from the fact that
a railway, in order to pay, must humour its traffic, and
would be attempting suicide were it really guilty of the
exorbitant overcharging and mismanagement of which
some lines are accused, there is little or no cause for
these complaints. In a country where a mortgage on
land pays 8 per cent. interest, and where other investments
are expected to give a proportionate return, the
7 per cent. of a railway dividend is far from being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">-&nbsp;7&nbsp;-</a></span>
excessive, especially when it is remembered that locusts
and drought may at any time absorb practically the
whole year&rsquo;s profits of a whole system.</p>

<p>The motive of this hostile spirit, or what may be
behind it, is difficult to discover. That jealousy of
foreign&mdash;especially English&mdash;influence exists in a certain
section of the people is undoubted. But, considering
that the true Argentine population&mdash;supposing that such
a thing exists or could be defined&mdash;is very small compared
with the foreign element, and that of itself it is absolutely
incapable of developing the country, some other reason
must exist to justify the position. But, discreditable as
such jealousy is to the people concerned, it is without
doubt a very powerful factor.</p>

<p>Fortunately, these opinions are not shared by the
Government, nor, probably by the people generally,
who, although always complaining of high freights,
delay in transport, and all the other grievances for which
every railway under the sun is blamed, seem to dread
the alternative of Government control. The official
members of the Government are on the whole considered
to be sincere, industrious men, with a genuine desire to
do their best. But Government management invariably
means peculation, among subordinates especially, and
the introduction of petty politics into business. It is from
this element that the opposition springs. Concessions
requested by capitalists, permission for extensions
required by existing concerns, although of undoubted
advantage to the country and approved by Government,
are blocked in Congress. The tone and quality of
Congress may be judged from the fact that the only
measure of any importance passed during a whole
session was that authorising an increase in the salaries
of the deputies. For weeks on end no meeting can be
held, be the measures to be discussed ever so important,
because, from carelessness or deliberate intention,
sufficient members do not appear to form a quorum.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">-&nbsp;8&nbsp;-</a></span>
Several deputies, indeed, never sit from the beginning
of the session to the end. Thus, even if there is no
opposition to a railway bill, it often happens that it is
as effectually blocked by the sheer slackness of individual
congressmen.</p>

<p>That the railways themselves are not blameless in
every respect stands to reason. And, although this is
almost certainly not the origin of the present obstruction
to their demands, they would command a much greater
share of sympathy&mdash;after all, a considerable asset&mdash;if
they would realise their own faults.</p>

<p>Having had, and still having, a practical monopoly
in their own districts, the various companies have adopted
a somewhat despotic attitude towards new and outside
enterprise, and, sometimes a disregard for the requirements
of their customers, as well as for the true needs of
the country. Railway affairs centre in River Plate
House, and any attempt on the part of outsiders to
establish themselves in the Argentine is viewed with
great suspicion by the financial ring that rules there.
Concessions put forward have been blocked times out of
number by the influence which the ring could exert in
Congress. If by any chance&mdash;and this has been more
frequent of late&mdash;the concessions have been secured in
spite of its opposition, every obstacle is placed in the
way of raising the requisite capital in London&mdash;opposition
which the ring is in a peculiar position to
make effective. Only recently a very sound project was
floated with the greatest difficulty, even the debentures
failing to realise more than 90 per cent., because one of
the existing lines considered the proposal a trespass on
its especial preserves. Moreover, there seems to be
every reason to anticipate the rapid failure of the new
line owing to the rate war which the existing one will
undoubtedly declare.</p>

<p>This apparent disregard of the needs or desires of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">-&nbsp;9&nbsp;-</a></span>
customers is, perhaps, attributable partly to the unreasonable
nature of the demand, partly to an occasional
pursuit of some pet theory of management, but, in all
probability, more largely to the division and conflict of
authority. The management is separated from its
central board, not only by the Atlantic, but by the local
board sitting in Buenos Aires. And, although on the
home board there are men whose knowledge of the
country was intimate some years previously, their aspect
of the working of a railway naturally undergoes considerable
modification upon their transference from the
executive to the directorate; while the local board, who
are often appointed merely to secure local support and
influence, are rather apt to exercise their power in a
vexatious and capricious manner&mdash;more to show their
authority than to further the interests of the railway.
As regards the actual working of the lines, in some cases
complaints are made that too much confidence is placed
in the long-haul, long-train theory. There are only a
few lines on which there is any opportunity for or
advantage in the very long train, the agricultural districts
centring round the various ports. Owing to the lack of
warehouse accommodation along the line, grain has often
to be loaded into the trains straight from the growers&rsquo;
carts, thus causing endless delay when trains of immense
length stand to be filled. It often happens, too, if the
harvest proves at all good, that, in spite of Government
orders, the rolling stock is quite inadequate for the traffic,
the result being that with the accumulation of work in
the docks, a crop is sometimes kept locally for a whole
year before it can be removed to a port.</p>

<p>Considerable inconvenience is caused, and will
continue to be caused for some time, by the congestion
at the port of Buenos Aires. Control there has been
exercised by half a dozen different boards with no central
authority. The wharfage and warehouse accommodation
are quite inadequate, even if the great savings possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">-&nbsp;10&nbsp;-</a></span>
in time and space were realised. And, lastly, although
there is already sufficient confusion with a one gauge
system, there is an immediate prospect of the introduction
of two other gauges. The existing lines there are
5 ft. 6 in. But preparations are already being made for
the continuation of the Central C&oacute;rdoba (metre gauge)
into the port, and possibly of the Entre Rios (4 ft. 8&frac12; in.)
extension as well.</p>

<p>The solution to the difficulty is at present very doubtful.
Increased accommodation to a limited extent is quite
possible in Buenos Aires itself, and with an immense
outlay of capital an entirely new set of docks might be
constructed there&mdash;though this is highly improbable.
The more reasonable course would undoubtedly be to
construct new ports or develop existing ones elsewhere,
a course that is already being adopted by the Southern
at Bahia Blanca, and the Entre Rios line at Ibicuy.
There is also a new project floated for the construction
of a large port in the Bay of Samborombon (also on the
Southern system), but this scheme does not meet with
much approval in the country, while, for some reason,
the port of La Plata has never succeeded, in spite of
every encouragement. At some time a port will have to
be constructed at Mar del Plata, where the only rock
foundation on the whole coast is to be found. Mar del
Plata is the Argentine Brighton, and any commercial
development there is certain of an unfavourable reception.
But as sand and mud are the only base from Santa F&eacute; to
Bahia Blanca&mdash;in some cases there being not even firm
sand&mdash;and as dredging is exceptionally expensive, no
other solution seems reasonable. On the Uruguay
River, and on the Eastern Bank of the <a name="Parana2" id="Parana2"></a>Paran&aacute;, in
the South of Entre Rios there is deep water. But as this
only affects the lines of that province and of Corrientes
it has no bearing on the general question of Argentine
transport.</p>

<p>As a last word, it must be remembered that the present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">-&nbsp;11&nbsp;-</a></span>
boom in the country is extremely recent. Argentine has
developed in an extraordinarily rapid manner, and some
confusion is excusable. That the railway and the
country will realise and overcome their difficulties there
can be little doubt. And in any case the natural wealth
of the country is so great that in the end it will force a
way out, in spite of obstacles.</p>

<span class="ltrspc">INDUSTRIES AND THE LABOUR QUESTION.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> labour question in the Argentine Republic is one of
great difficulty. There is really no native labour,
certainly none for industrial purposes. The Gaucho,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"
href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
now degenerated into the peon,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"
href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> is only available for
stock-raising. Agriculture is carried on almost entirely
by colonists of various nationalities, and industries by
Italian immigrants only. There is one exception, the
sugar industry of the north. There conditions are so
very different from those in the centre and the south,
that it must be treated as almost a separate country.
While the north-east&mdash;the Chaco district&mdash;is still in so
uncivilised a state that its possibilities are very hazy.
The Quebracho trade yields very large returns with
Indian labour, but Indian labour is an unknown
quantity. Uncivilized Indians still cause considerable
trouble there, and opinions differ considerably as to the
possibility of employing them successfully for cotton
growing and other new enterprises.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2" href="#FNanchor_2_2">
2.</a>&emsp;Peon is the name applied to all labourers.</p>
</div>

<p>The more important question is that relating to labour
for factories, workshops, and railways in the central part
of the Republic, and in the towns themselves. That a
country situated so far from the great centres of production
should continue to import nearly all its necessities
as well as luxuries seems incredible. Yet the tendency
is certainly more in the direction of increased importation
than of home manufacture. There is a tariff of exceptional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">-&nbsp;13&nbsp;-</a></span>
severity on every conceivable article, but even this fails to
develop industries in the country. Breweries, flour mills
and repairing shops seem to be the only successful
growths, with a few isolated instances, such as canvas
shoe factories and similar works. Even the production
of such essentially native goods as &ldquo;ponchos&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"
href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> has
lapsed in favour of German and Italian wares. While
the manufacture of matches&mdash;in the hands of a powerful
monopoly, bolstered up by privileges and an exorbitant
duty&mdash;was so seriously jeopardised by a strike last year,
that the threat was made&mdash;whether seriously or not,
cannot be said&mdash;of closing down the works and importing
immediately from England and Sweden. (It is satisfactory
to note in this connection that an English firm
promptly stepped forward and made an offer to the
Government that if a reduction was made in the duty, it
would undertake to place on the market, within little
more than a month, some millions of boxes of matches).</p><!--punc'n as original-->

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3" href="#FNanchor_3_3">
3.</a>&emsp;&ldquo;Ponchos&rdquo; are the peculiar rugs with a central slit to admit the
head when the &ldquo;poncho&rdquo; is used as a cloak. They are used universally
in the country.</p>
</div>

<p>Even those industries, however, that flourish, do so in
spite of their labour. They are all, it will be observed,
concerned with the production of goods that are either
expensive or difficult to transport, and only the direst
necessity could prevent their home manufacture.
In the course of last year there were two general strikes
(in Buenos Aires and Rosario) besides numerous small
ones. Dock labourers seem to be continually in partial
ferment, and even the most generous treatment does
not prevent railway employees from stopping work
occasionally. The causes of this instability are fairly
apparent, though the same cannot be said of the remedy.</p>

<p>For various reasons industrial labour is entirely
supplied by Italian immigrants, mostly Neapolitans.
The other nationalities who come into the country engage
for the most part in agricultural work, either as colonists,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">-&nbsp;14&nbsp;-</a></span>
buying their land, or as tenant farmers on short leases.
Skilled English and other European labour is also
employed in factories, but only for the higher grades of
work, and in positions of some responsibility. Thus
the available labour is recruited from the lower class of
immigrants, and from a race not remarkable for stability.</p>

<p>In the second place, living in the capital is extremely
dear, not least being the price of house accommodation.
Although an Italian can satisfy his requirements at a
much lower rate than an Englishman could his, yet even
he can scarcely make both ends meet, while the excess
of expenditure over receipts is particularly galling in the
land of promise. Recently, too, additional grievances
have been introduced by the wholesale eviction of tenants
owing to the purchase by syndicates of whole blocks of
buildings, and the subsequent re-letting of them at
immensely increased prices. In the first six months of
last year there were more than eleven thousand petitions
for evictions before the justices. With a discontented
and excitable working population, therefore, as a field
for their activities it is not surprising that the agitators,
of whom there is no lack, should be so successful.
Attempts are being made by various large concerns to
supply reasonable accommodation for their employees,
and more than one railway has been particularly liberal
in this respect. But it was only a short time ago that a
strike of very serious dimensions was declared in the
workshops of one of the most generous, on the most
ridiculous pretext.</p>

<p>The great danger in all labour troubles in the
Argentine lies in the fact that they are apt to become
general and paralyse trade. It is usually impossible to
secure &ldquo;blacklegs,&rdquo; a circumstance which the workmen
fully realise. Moreover, owing to the peculiar economic
conditions of the country, a strike on the part of the
workmen in one industry means that all the workmen
in that industry stop work; and, as trade is usually in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">-&nbsp;15&nbsp;-</a></span>
state of congestion, the difficulties created are enormous.
A dock strike in Buenos Aires is doubly serious, because
the port is already overcrowded, and there is no
alternative port suitable. A match strike, with the
present tariff, causes a match famine. A railway strike
is sure to break out only when the year&rsquo;s harvest must
be negotiated. And should any single strike show signs
of missing fire, in all probability the result is a
sympathetic strike on the part of all workmen, including
cab-drivers and bakers.</p>

<p>The problem before the Government is very serious,
if, indeed, it is not a question which it would be wise
for the parties concerned to work out for themselves.
Considerable success is reported to have attended the
efforts of the Western Railway, who have instituted a
conciliation board for the mutual consideration of
difficulties with their employees. But unless by some
means the cost of living is reduced, it is difficult to
see how satisfactory conclusions can be attained. If
prices continue to rise as, in all probability they will, a
rise in wages will be imperative. This, in the case of
railways would mean an increase in rates, as there are
few who are earning more than a reasonable dividend,
while an increase in rates would cause great dissatisfaction
to the whole agrarian population; after all by far the
most important in the country. It is even doubtful
whether cereals could stand any heavier rates than they
bear at present.</p>

<p>The root of the labourer&rsquo;s dissatisfaction lies, as has
been said, in the high cost of living. Unless this can be
lowered, there can be no hope of a final settlement. And
the only means of lowering it is a reduction in the tariff
and a greater mobility of trade in the interior.</p>

<a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br /><br />
<span class="ltrspc">FOREIGN CAPITAL AND PUBLIC DEBT.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not the intention to deal in this work with the
market fluctuations, the arrangements made between
provincial banks and their creditors, nor with any of the
financial aspects which these questions have recently
assumed. Such a course would not only be out of place,
but would be of little interest or value, owing to the
unstable state in which the negotiations are at present.
The object will be rather to indicate the part that foreign
capital has played in the development of the country and
that played by politics in finance.</p>

<p>An important fact to realise is that the liberation of the
country from the Spanish colonial system is comparatively
recent, and that a people unfitted in every way for
political independence was suddenly put in possession of
a country of quite exceptional richness but absolutely
undeveloped and almost unpopulated. Men with no
political experience nor education found the road open
to responsible positions requiring statesmanlike qualities
in an unusually high degree&mdash;not only financial, but
diplomatic and administrative ability combined with
absolute integrity. It is sufficiently well known how far
they came up to the requirements. For it is only at the
present day that political morality has found a place in
the national executive. In provincial administration and
in the ranks of the deputies it is doubtful whether it will
ever predominate.</p>

<p>It is a favourite complaint of Argentines that their
country is regarded in Europe as a hot-bed of revolution.
They are never weary of complaining that their claim to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">-&nbsp;17&nbsp;-</a></span>
be a civilized power is disregarded. In the absence of a
definition of civilization the question must be left open.
But as regards revolutions the European idea is
substantially correct. Argentines have undoubtedly not
yet realised a sane conception of government.</p>

<p>If those in power fail to convince the country of any
sincerity or appreciation of their responsibilities, the
people themselves do not treat the authority of government
with the respect that alone permits the growth of
those qualities of statesmanship whose absence is so very
obvious.</p>

<p>One improvement, however, must be noted, an
improvement of the very greatest importance. Whereas
in former years little respect was paid to non-partisans,
the people have now learnt that it is to everyone&rsquo;s
interest to confine political differences to the actual
disputants&mdash;to fight their battles in their own garden,
and to leave neighbours at peace. Capital, therefore, is
tolerably safe, especially as the federal executive is a
body which, if not possessed in every branch of the
greatest intelligence or even honesty, is at least controlled
by men who realise their position and have sympathies
and knowledge beyond the limits of their country.</p>

<p>The considerations just mentioned bear more especially
on capital sunk in land and its immediate connexions, or
in industrial concerns. As regards public debt, the
question is more involved. The laxity of public morality
has here the disastrous tendency of making a party
temporarily in power regard the actions of its predecessors
as invalid. The temptation is certainly great. When a
foreign loan has been contracted in the name of a
municipality or provincial government, at the expense of
the people at large, but is used purely for party or even
private ends, it is at least comprehensible that an
opposing party should regard the loan as an unwarrantable
exploitation of the public, and should think it
justifiable to allow the creditors to suffer instead of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">-&nbsp;18&nbsp;-</a></span>
own countrymen, who were no party to the transaction.
The policy and ethics of such a view are another matter.
And it is, as usual, the honest who suffer. For, if the
succeeding party are possessed of higher views in the sphere
of political morality, owing to the necessity of regarding
their predecessors&rsquo; really fraudulent contracts as binding
on themselves for fulfilment, the profit goes to the malefactors,
while the odium incurred in realising the money
to cancel the obligation falls on the unoffending upholders
of honesty.</p>

<p>The extraordinary feature that impresses itself on the
mind when looking through the history of Argentine
loans is the readiness with which London financiers
responded to the invitations. No more remarkable case,
probably, could be found in the whole history of finance
than that of the Buenos Aires Provincial Bank, its
absolutely reckless mismanagement and of the inevitable
collapse which followed&mdash;resulting, as everyone knows,
in the failure of Messrs. Baring. This catastrophe set
back Argentine progress several years, and it is only now
that the recovery is at all complete.</p>

<p>But it can scarcely be emphasised too strongly that
the recovery is complete. Argentine national credit is as
sound as that of any civilised power. Indeed, the fact
that the national Government undertook the responsibility
of so great a part of the debts of the provinces is in
itself sufficient indication of the Government&rsquo;s policy.
With regard to municipal loans, it must be admitted that
as these are regarded nowhere as other than a highly
speculative investment, future irregularities would fall
on the heads of people who had full knowledge of their
risks. But the risks are extremely small compared with
those which existed formerly; and the national executive
seems inclined to exert pressure on recalcitrant bodies,
compelling them to adhere to their agreements. In a
recent case, indeed, intervention was necessary, not in
the interests of the financiers, but in that of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">-&nbsp;19&nbsp;-</a></span>
municipality, the extraordinary exactions of the French
port-concessionnaires at Rosario, having had very
disastrous effects on that town&rsquo;s development. For once
the municipal authorities were not the only gainers and
the people themselves were the sufferers.</p>

<p>Before presenting figures of Argentine loans in detail
it may be of interest to show the proportion which was
taken up in London. Of the total raised by the Republic
from its emancipation in 1822 until 1904, amounting to
&pound;152,326,460, Great Britain supplied nearly four-fifths,
namely, &pound;125,082,710. This total is made up of the
National, Provincial and Municipal external debts, which
amount severally to $540,770,156, $202,067,716,
$24,868,480 gold, or roughly &pound;108,000,000, &pound;40,000,000
and &pound;4,500,000 sterling, of which England provided
approximately six-sevenths, two-thirds and of the last,
all. When it is remembered that of the capital invested
in the country commercially three-quarters (or 250 out of
326 million pounds sterling) are also British, the
influence which this country has had on Argentine
progress cannot be over-estimated.</p>

<p>It is a point, by the way, that a preference on colonial
produce would be a preference against these interests of
ours in the Argentine as well as against the 30,000
people of British extraction resident there, of whom at
least one-half must be engaged or interested in the
rearing or exporting of cattle. In grain they would be
affected but little.</p>

<p>In estimating the meaning of this tremendous debt it
must be remembered that much of it is repetition. Not
only were many of the loans issued for conversion of
floating and other existent debt, but it will be noticed
that a considerable part of the national debt was
contracted to liquidate the various indebtedness of
different provinces.</p>

<a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a><br /><br />
<span class="ltrspc">ARGENTINA FROM THE IMMIGRANT&rsquo;S STANDPOINT.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> seems to be the ambition of every new country to
secure immigration at all costs, regardless of the
prospects that really exist there, and also of the true
interests of the country. The result of this policy at its
best leads only to a boom, with its inevitable reaction.
The wiser plan of letting the country gradually develop
itself, admitting cheerfully the adventurous spirits who
are ready to come without invitation or advertisement
rarely seems to commend itself to colonial politicians.
Argentina at one time seemed more than likely to
compete with Australia and Canada in this respect,
trying to allure colonists with impossible promises of free
land and gigantic crops, and only the untiring efforts
of the Englishmen already established there have
prevented that country realising the inevitable consequence.
The present Argentine Government admit the
unsuitable nature of the country for impecunious
Englishmen, and confine their attentions to attracting
Italians and other foreigners, for whom the climate and
conditions of labour are certainly more adapted. But
even these are beginning to discover that expectations
and fulfilments do not always coincide. The truth is
that, as is heard from all parts of the world, special
knowledge or capital is indispensable in every new
country, but that with these the chances of success in life
are considerably greater than at home. To the Englishman,
however, in the Argentine, there is the additional
difficulty of the language&mdash;a difficulty which were he not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">-&nbsp;21&nbsp;-</a></span>
an Englishman would be almost negligible, for Spanish
is an easy language of which to acquire a working
command.</p>

<p>It is the firm belief of every Englishman, apparently,
that certain skill in athletics of necessity qualifies him for
cattle farming. Although he is physically well enough
suited to camp life, the whole truth is apt to be a
disillusionment. The market for athletic young men is
already glutted, and though many estancieros take on an
additional overseer or apprentice to please a friend, in
many cases they do not in the least appreciate bestowing
the favour. It must not be supposed that Englishmen
are not wanted on estancias. On the contrary, even
Argentines usually prefer an English manager. The
only difficulty is that the supply of raw material exceeds
the demand. The young man who goes out to seek his
fortune is usually one with no qualification but an agreeable
manner and a good physique, desirable enough
assets, but not such as to entitle the holder to an extravagant
salary. The wisest plan, therefore, that an
immigrant of this sort can pursue is to go to an estancia
as an apprentice for a nominal salary of twenty or thirty
pounds a year, on a three or four year&rsquo;s<!--as original--> contract. Work
is very hard, though often the actual conditions of life
are extremely comfortable, but the education required is
thorough and qualifies for a position of majordomo at
the end of the contract. Many men who possess some
capital, or expect to possess it, also go through this
training as it enables them to invest their money wisely,
and later to work it economically.</p>

<p>There are many, however, who find the work and
conditions of life trying, especially on an inferior estancia,
and take the first opportunity offered to change their
occupation. The usual change is to a bank or a railway.
Both are regarded as a last resource, because, although
the pay (anything from &pound;100 a year) is considerably
higher than in camp life, expenses are considerably more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">-&nbsp;22&nbsp;-</a></span>
so; while there is less chance of promotion because the
better positions naturally fall to men with a special railway
training who enter the service from home under contract.
For a really able man there are undoubtedly good
prospects on Argentine railways, and the difference in
salary between that of an employee there and that of one
in a similar position at home more than compensates for
the increased cost of living. In Banks the salaries are
much the same as on railways to begin with, but chances
of promotion are said to be less, while the work does not
give so many opportunities of seeing the country, and
to many is intrinsically less interesting.</p>

<p>In business houses there is never a chance of employment,
except, of course, through personal influence.
English clerks are employed very little, and there are no
positions corresponding to the large book-keeping staffs
of banks and railways, nor to the assistants, and
secretaries to chiefs of departments, the inspectors and
superintendents of the latter.</p>

<p>For the Englishman it is very fortunate that the
lethargic, and often untrustworthy character of Latin
races requires constant surveillance. But for the same
reason it is obviously impossible for employers to choose
their overseers at random, and a personal introduction
is almost indispensable. In giving this short sketch of
the prospects open to the English immigrant no mention
has been made of the immigrant labourer or artisan.
The reason of this is that in this respect Argentine must
be regarded almost as a tropical country, where English
labour is out of the question. Italian and English
labour cannot work together, not only from incompatibility
of temperament but because the Italian can work
for considerably less than the Englishman. In addition,
the climate in summer is far too hot for the latter. There
are exceptions to be found, notably in the case of butchers
at the freezing works, and that of some engine drivers,
and engine-shop artificers. But, as the drivers are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">-&nbsp;23&nbsp;-</a></span>
compelled by law to speak and understand Spanish, they
are not numerous. In any case, there is absolutely no
opening for a labourer or artisan, unless he comes to the
country to take up a definite vacancy that has been
offered him.</p>

<p>Regarded, however, as a country for the Italian
immigrant the prospects are certainly better, although
not so dazzling as he is led to believe in his own country.
Such popular phrases as &ldquo;immense zones which merely
await the strong arm of the colonist for their development&rdquo;
fall, unfortunately, rather short of the truth.
The tendency is to lay all land possible under alfalfa,
only such as is incapable of growing it being sold for
agriculture. Large tracts, nevertheless, are being formed
into colonies by land development companies, and in the
past have been so divided by government, a system
which gives good returns to the farmer. The latter,
however, is rather inclined to work his land to death,
often without rotation, and, though actual exhaustion
is very remote, the rest afforded by a year&rsquo;s fallow and
leguminous crops is rendered impossible for a variety of
reasons.</p>

<p>A mischievous result of the financial standing of many
of the colonists is their frequent lapse into the power of
the local store-keeper. There are no branch banks in the
camp towns and often no grain dealer apart from this
<a name="accommodating" id="accommodating"></a>accommodating tradesman. In return for very elastic
credit, based on crop expectations, he buys the whole
yield at his own price, and, as he has a <a name="monopoly" id="monopoly"></a>monopoly of the
retail trade as well, he secures a large profit on both
transactions. In his defence it must be admitted that he
runs a very great risk indeed in the credit which he is
compelled to give, and is justified to a great extent in
recouping himself when the opportunity occurs. But
the undeveloped economic system, and the encouragement
of settlers without a sufficient backing of capital,
are much to be deplored. In recent years the agriculture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">-&nbsp;24&nbsp;-</a></span>
of a whole province threatened to come to an abrupt
termination owing to the complete inability of the
colonists to buy or borrow from the merchants seed for
their year&rsquo;s sowing. It was only rescued by the prompt
and wise action of the local railway company who
supplied the grain, on the easiest of terms and without
security. The result was, although, of course, an
immediate loss to the company, the salvation of the
province, and the railway&rsquo;s ultimate gain.</p>

<p>Owing to the enterprise of various people there seems
to be a possibility that the colonist&rsquo;s conservative
partiality to cereals may be overcome. Not only have
the possibilities of chicken-farming been demonstrated,
but the co-operative working of a large dairy and ice-producing
plant has already proved a success. The
co-operative movement may indeed open a field, especially
in the South, for other labour besides that of Latin
origin. It is true that the Boer Colony has not been an
unqualified success. But the Welsh have thrived in
Chubut, and of the newly opened regions about Nahuel-Huapi
residents speak enthusiastically. Unfortunately
there does not seem to be much land available, and,
hitherto, there have been no railway facilities. There
is a paper dealing with the Welsh Colony, published
by the Foreign Office in London. But, apart from the
accounts of sporting and scientific expeditions, there is
little available literature. It is much to be deplored,
and in default of an independent work in English the
translation of existing works in other languages would
be very welcome.</p>

<span class="ltrspc">ENGLISH TRADE. ITS POSITION AND PROSPECTS.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is always difficult to entice commercial men into
giving information of any value regarding their affairs.
The seeker after more material and solid things than
figures&mdash;after instances and facts rather than theories&mdash;is
very apt to be disappointed. The value of the
opinions gleaned was rather impaired when experience
showed that success and complacency, despondency and
comparative failure, usually went together. It is pleasant
to be told not to bother about British Trade, that
&ldquo;British trade is all right.&rdquo; But it is not entirely
reassuring when such lessons as can be derived from
statistics and the opinions of less successful men are
largely opposed to this view.</p>

<p>Some more definite information was, however, available,
and from conversation with people directly
concerned with general trade, both English and
Argentines, it was possible to supplement to some
extent the statements, extremely valuable as they are,
of our consuls in the country, as well as the deductions
from official statistics. With regard to consular reports
a word must be said. These are often abused by men
of position in trade, and, though their brevity is to be
deplored, a word of protest must be uttered against the
inconsiderate and disdainful criticism to which they are
subjected. Moreover, one of the greatest authorities on
Argentine affairs, Dr. Francisco Moreno, an Argentine
delegate on Col. Holditch&rsquo;s arbitration expedition on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">-&nbsp;26&nbsp;-</a></span>
the Chilian Frontier, was emphatic in his approval of
these reports, even going so far as to say that he trusted
their statements and figures in preference to those of his
own government.</p>

<p>On every hand there were indications leading to two
conclusions, namely that British trade is losing, or has
lost considerable ground, and that the greater part of
the blame is due to the producer or merchant at home.
A superficial glance at import statistics would seem to
give the lie direct to any such assertion. Such strong
influences, however, are at work, that it is only after a
careful study of all the circumstances that anything like
a true estimate can be formed.</p>

<p>Before, therefore, pronouncing judgment upon its
present position and its future, a short examination of the
development of our trade viewed in conjunction with
the economic conditions of the country and with the
various interests in competition with ours, is necessary
both to explain how our conclusions were reached,
and to assist in the formation of a juster appreciation
of our commercial relations with the country.</p>

<p>The following statistics give in brief the course of
trade in the Argentine according to official returns for
the years 1890, <a name="Y1895" id="Y1895"></a>1895, and 1900 to 1905 inclusive:&mdash;</p>

<p>For the total kilometrage of the year 1904 the same
authority gives 18,412 kilometres, a considerable
discrepancy from the official figures. Of the two
authorities the government statistics are generally
regarded as the less trustworthy. But whatever the
true figures may be, the proportion owned by British
interests will not be lessened by the total of the more
optimistic estimate, which is based largely on unrealised
concessions. And in any case, the economic point to be
<a name="emphasised" id="emphasised"></a>emphasised is not weakened, namely the overwhelming
preponderance of British influence in this direction.
Moreover, not only has this influence been increasing
relatively to that of competitors, but, absolutely, the
increase is exceedingly great.</p>

<p>We have, then, in this department of industry a
market for goods of proportions that quite exceed those
of any other in the country, the greatest impetus to its
development being given by the admission into the
country of all railway material duty-free. In any
estimate therefore, of the true position of any country&rsquo;s
trade, this privileged demand must be considered. And
in estimating future conditions, the tendency noted in
the chapter on railways must be borne in mind, viz., the
tendency to discourage the continuance of the quasi-monopoly
of one country.</p>

<p>Turning next to the immigration returns, the predominating
position held by the Latin races, and, especially,
of the Italian, is at once apparent. Although in many
cases the special requirements of these people can only
be satisfied by the goods produced in their own several
countries, the greater part of the demand for imported
goods is for clothing, and, in the case of the country
portion, for agricultural materials. In both these departments
the market is open. On the other hand, while
the greatest attention seems to have been paid to this
market by foreign merchants, the wants of the inhabitants
of British and other Northern extraction living in the far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">-&nbsp;32&nbsp;-</a></span>
South have not been studied at all. In this context the
following extract from a recent consular report is of
interest. Writing from Puerto Gallegos in Patagonia
the Acting Consular Agent declares:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;German and French exporters are gradually securing
the best part of the trade in consequence of the greater
attention shewn by them to the large importing houses in
Gallegos. It is said that the merchant prefers to order
British goods to suit the taste of their farmer clients but
so little attention is shewn to them by the British
exporters that they are obliged to place their orders on
the Continent. Many British firms refuse to attend to
orders in Spanish, and their catalogues and price-lists
are almost invariably printed in English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the same report comes a remark of the Vice-Consul
at Bahia Blanca emphasising the energy with
which the Hamburg South American Company fosters
the coasting trade. The Pacific Steam Navigating boats
pass to and from the West Coast, but the local trade is
scarcely touched by them. Although a German line
does not imply nothing but German trade, the tendency
must, of necessity, be in its favour.</p>

<p>The question of the nature of demand cannot be over-emphasised.
It is owing to neglect of this that the
greatest mistakes are made both in practice and in argument.
Up to 1880 the nation&rsquo;s demands were those of
any immature nation. Subsequently to that date the
country began to boom and the whole economic condition
was altered. Whereas previous to that date the market
was for articles for private use, whether domestic,
agricultural, or personal, subsequent to the national
awakening private needs became insignificant compared
with those of public bodies. Not only was the construction
of railways commenced in earnest but national and
municipal contracts were issued broadcast. Harbours,
sewage and water-works, lighting, tramways, and every
other form of public enterprise, were initiated from that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">-&nbsp;33&nbsp;-</a></span>
time onward. But, whereas the earlier works were
largely executed by English firms, of recent years foreign
(in particular Belgian) contractors have secured the concessions.
The methods employed by the latter, however,
have been such as rather to disgust the country with its
experiment. The case which has been causing intense
excitement is that of the Rosario Port-works. The
French <i>concessionnaires</i> made a bad job there of a
difficult undertaking. That, however, was little compared
with the terms which by some means they
managed to insert into their concession, terms by virtue
of which they were enabled to make the most extraordinary
exactions from everyone who entered the port,
regardless of the fact that many of the wharves were the
property of other concerns. On the other hand, the
English firm that constructed the Rosario sewage system,
and constructed it with the greatest thoroughness, were
treated to a series of vexatious interferences culminating
in a refusal on the part of the municipality to pay for
the work.</p>

<p>Besides the above mentioned work, ports have been
constructed at Bahia Blanca, La Plata, Buenos Aires,
San Nicolas, <a name="Santa" id="Santa"></a>Santa F&eacute;, Paran&aacute; (not yet completed) and
other places, so that some two hundred million sterling
have been invested in works of public utility in a country
with a population at the present time of about five
million inhabitants. Apart from the importance of this
development of public enterprises as regards the nature
of imports, its importance is obviously no less in the
matter of their extent. Adding to the capital of public
undertakings the capital employed in trade, the total of
commercially invested money was estimated at the end
of 1904 at 326 million sterling; but, if national provincial
and municipal loans are taken into account, the grand
total of foreign capital in the country probably exceeds
&pound;450,000,000. This immense influx of capital naturally
caused imports greatly to exceed exports, but the excess<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">-&nbsp;34&nbsp;-</a></span>
is not perhaps so large as might have been expected,
owing to the high tariff which probably increased the
import of bullion.</p>

<p>Recently, since the investments have begun to give
returns, the balance of trade has turned, and, whereas
in 1890 the sale of exports (in dollars gold) was to that
of imports as 100&middot;82 millions to 142&middot;24, in 1905 the former
had risen to 322&middot;84 millions, and the latter only to 205&middot;15.
Even then it is hardly credible that exported interest
should have equalled, much less exceeded, the new
capital invested, and the alternative of gold shipments
must be admitted.</p>

<p>We have then a rising tendency in the price of commodities,
or a depreciation of money (quite irrespective,
of course, of the depreciation of paper). The theory of
rising prices is, as is well known a favourite in the
States. But in this, as in almost every other case, the
application of an economic theory is rendered very nearly
impossible owing to conflicting influences.</p>

<p>To return once more to the details of Argentine trade,
we found that the predominating demand had been that
of the railways, and that of the railways by far the
greater part is British.</p>

<p>Apart from inclinations of sentiment or personal
partiality, it is only natural that engines and other
material should be imported from England, as being of
a type to which English engineers are accustomed. A
very large proportion of our trade comes under this
heading, and, it must be admitted, the market here is
not free. Even so, however, the superiority or greater
suitability&mdash;whether in material, construction, or price&mdash;of
foreign work in some directions has ousted the British
product. For example, in steel rails England&rsquo;s quota
went down one thousand tons in 1905, while <a name="thatofthe" id="thatofthe"></a>that of the
States went up fifty-three thousand. So, too, in such
goods as axes and small tools the latter hold the market.
On the other hand, American locomotives have not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">-&nbsp;35&nbsp;-</a></span>
proved a success&mdash;the English system of running not
being that for which they are designed.</p>

<p>English engineers seem to prefer a solid, well-finished
engine, which can stand accidents, and innumerable
repairs. The Baldwin engine is cheap, but apparently
of indifferent finish, and is built on a rigid frame. The
slightest accident to this incapacitates the whole machine,
and, in any case, the locomotive is built for hard use
over a short period, with subsequent scrapping. Neither
the traffic nor the capital of Argentine railways justify
such a course. The actual figures of imports of
locomotives for 1905 are&mdash;United Kingdom 91, U.S.A.
16, Belgium 9, Germany 46&mdash;increases of 27, 8, 7, and
22 respectively. English engines are the most
expensive. The German engines are largely those
employed in construction. In railway material (not
specified) although England exported to the value
of $384,342 gold the increase over 1904 was $703,548
gold, yet America with an export of only $470,527, shows
an increase of $411,876. Thus even in the privileged
domain of the railway market, there are signs of very
keen competition appearing. This may not prove
effective for some time, the connection between the home
contractors and the London board being intimate, and
there is a danger of its possibility being overlooked.</p>

<p>Another important demand is that for tramway
material. In this it is satisfactory to see that there is a
favourable tendency in favour of English goods. Previously,
no doubt, the greater knowledge and experience
in the States enabled them to supply cars and material
more readily than in England, and the possession by
Germany of the Buenos Aires electric works favoured
its exportation of the latter. But recently some Preston
cars have been put on the road which give the greatest
satisfaction. The increase in electric traction in England
ought to furnish the experience necessary for the successful
development of this branch of trade.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">-&nbsp;36&nbsp;-</a></span>
In Agricultural machinery the market is absolutely
open, and where there is any opportunity, English firms
have undoubtedly succeeded. It is unreasonable to
expect that we should be able to compete with the States
in sowing, reaping, ploughing, and similar machinery,
provided as they are with an experimental field with
conditions similar to those prevalent in the Argentine.
But in traction engines the Lincoln firms outstrip all
their competitors. Rushton, Proctor and Co., Clayton
and Shuttleworth, Ransomes, Sims and Jefferies, are
names that may be seen all over the country. The
genuine solidity of construction in their engines, combined
with adaptability to the country&rsquo;s requirements,
has for once overcome the overwhelming attraction of
cheapness. Considerable success has also attended their
threshing machines, in spite of their comparatively
greater expense and of various other factors in favour
of American machines.</p>

<p>The case of Agricultural implements is curious. While
in axes the United States have increased their already
large export, though under the heading of spades, picks,
&amp;c., their export of 680 tons in 1905 is 8 tons greater than
in 1904, the value is &pound;1900 less, while the English 590
tons is 167.5 tons more than in the previous year with an
increase in value of &pound;8080.</p>

<p>In cotton goods there is again a natural <a name="monopoly2" id="monopoly2"></a>monopoly&mdash;the
preponderating Italian influence among the working
classes encouraging the trade with that country in the
special line of goods which appeals to them.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most important factor in international
trade is the nationality of the importers. In 1823 nearly
all the merchants in Buenos Aires were Scotch, and the
preponderance of British houses continued until recent
years. Then, however, for various reasons&mdash;the
development, perhaps, of the wool trade on the
Continent and the allurements of finance, owing to which
many British merchants invested in land and other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">-&nbsp;37&nbsp;-</a></span>
enterprises, in preference to the less congenial uncertainties
of trade&mdash;a large number of foreign, especially
German, houses appeared, turning the current of trade
more in the direction of that country. Whatever the
reasons may have been, at the present moment Germany
is firmly established in the country, and its trade is
continually increasing. It must be added, that although
German firms have a natural preference for dealing with
their own country, they are always ready to do business
with English houses provided that the latter make it
profitable for them to do so.</p>

<p>It will be convenient to deal here with the
complaints made by importers in the Argentine, of
English exporters, and the faults that the latter have to
find with the conditions of trade in that country.</p>

<p>Briefly, the chief complaint made of the English
manufacturer and merchant is lack of adaptability&mdash;the
well-worn objection that appears in every Consular
report, and is repeated even by tradesmen in this
country. The ways in which he shows his stubbornness
may seem trifling, but their importance is sufficiently
great in practice. Price-lists published solely in
English, with those measures and prices which are a
continual nightmare to the foreigner, get-up packing
that do not quite meet local taste, all these are apparently
trivial, but they affect the balance of trade nevertheless.</p>

<p>In cutlery, English goods have been entirely ousted
from the popular market. The large British population in
the country, however, as well as the wealthier Argentines
themselves, who as a rule are extremely partial to English
goods, from socks to agricultural machinery, still insist
on Sheffield blades, which in the best shops are often the
only ones procurable. But the popular demand is for a
cheaper article, often manufactured in the country. This
the English manufacturer has consistently refused to
supply, his reasons being, firstly, that he does not make
it, and secondly, that if he did, it would ruin his reputation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">-&nbsp;38&nbsp;-</a></span>
for good work. The plan adopted abroad of not
fixing the maker&rsquo;s name to an inferior article would
safeguard the reputation which the English producer
undoubtedly does possess. In this connection it is
a strange anomaly that the impression still holds
good in England, and seems to prevail even in other
countries, that German goods are of inferior quality.
This erroneous idea does not, of course, apply
to such things as armour plates and machinery. But
in the popular mind the impression created by toys
&ldquo;made in Germany&rdquo; has spread to all small articles
emanating from that country. If the work of any country
deserves this stigma it is that of America. The undeniable
ingenuity and neatness of American products is,
unfortunately, very often combined with bad workmanship.
In Argentine, according to some authorities,
disappointed buyers of American goods are returning to
more solid work. Undoubtedly the field for cheap goods
is favourable in that country, the moneyless colonists
being compelled to buy them irrespective of quality.
Besides, there is a delight, to which the Italian is peculiarly
susceptible, in always having something new. A bright
and new thing pleases most people more than a solid
article many years old. And in many directions the
yearly improvements and inventions soon reduce the
latter to a position of economic inferiority.</p>

<p>Turning to the exporters&rsquo; complaints, there are two
which must be admitted reasonable. In the first place,
the economic conditions of the country as well as the
inclinations of the people require exaggerated credit.</p>

<p>Nothing, apparently, will alter this, and the merchant
who refuses to take business on these terms must
expect to lose it altogether. The other is one that is
capable of removal. The English merchant frequently
complains that he cannot come into touch with his
ultimate customers. The taxes levied on commercial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">-&nbsp;39&nbsp;-</a></span>
travellers are exorbitant, each province vying with the
other in preventing their entrance. From this it follows
that few firms can afford to send representatives further
afield than Buenos Aires or Rosario, and practically all
business is conducted through the larger importing
houses of the capital. This is an absolutely prohibitive
system that is bound to have the most disastrous effects
on the expansion of trade. The intention is no doubt
protective. But in a country that is naturally incapable
of any industrial development, the policy cannot be
considered as anything but unwise.</p>

<p>As regards the travellers sent out by English firms,
they are often inadequately equipped for the work they
have to perform. Knowledge of the language, coupled
with knowledge of the article whose sale they have come
to promote, and an ability to quote credit terms offhand
in terms of dollars and kilos, are important. Too much
reliance is often placed on written matter which a
busy merchant has no time to read. A descriptive
pamphlet or book is an extremely valuable adjunct to an
obvious price list and an intelligent traveller. But by
itself it is of little value.</p>

<p>A further point, and one of some importance, is that
Argentines expect immediate delivery of orders.
Recently a large English motor car firm opened an
agency in Buenos Aires. The cars were much admired,
and as they were well boomed at an opportune moment,
a great many orders were secured. Owing, however, to
considerable delay in delivery, these were withdrawn,
and the orders were transferred to French firms.</p>

<p>Finally, a word must be said of proprietary articles.
In these no fault can be found with British manufacturers.
Soap, lime juice, whisky, mustard, jam, and even soda
water and ginger beer, are among the special products
that may be seen almost anywhere throughout the
country, and this branch of trade is capable of even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">-&nbsp;40&nbsp;-</a></span>
greater development with judicious advertising. In
particular, jam is invariably liked by Argentines of all
classes, and were it pushed a very large consumption
might follow. At present there is only one firm of any
note whose products are seen in the shops. The same
may be said of biscuits, although both in this and in the
former case, the high tariff (about 50% to 60% of the
value) would be a great restriction.</p>

<a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br /><br />
<span class="ltrspc">THE TARIFF.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Argentina</span> is professedly a protectionist country. It is
also professedly Republican, with a philosophic ideal of
the greatest good of the greatest number. The two
ideas, however, have not achieved a complete harmony.
This was perhaps inevitable. Curiously enough, the
vital <a name="industries" id="industries"></a>industries of the country have not been favoured
in any way by the fiscal system, which has been used to
foster exotics and economic growths hardly suited to the
conditions of the country.</p>

<p>In the Argentine there can be no question of &ldquo;Back
to the Land&rdquo;; there has never been any departure. But
until the present chief of the Department of Commerce
began his campaign for a rational tariff, there seems to
have been a tacit assumption that factories constituted
wealth. That the country should remain permanently
agricultural was never advised. It was assumed that it
must manufacture, and on this assumption the national
policy was directed. As a matter of fact, there was
probably no reasoned determination at all. Some
industries existed originally before communication was
established on the present great scale with the rest of
the world. As time went on these suffered from outside
competition, and protection was invoked and secured.
Other industries were then started speculatively
and for them similar protection was granted. If
prevailing opinion is of any value, it was even
impossible for an industry to succeed except by
political jobbery. Even now the evil appears to be very
far from removed, and the difficulties experienced by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">-&nbsp;42&nbsp;-</a></span>
English Railway companies are partly attributable to
this cause. These have consistently refused to bribe,
and it may be said that almost without exception they
have adhered to this rule. The nearest approach to this
form of persuasion is the nomination of influential
Argentines to the local board of the company, and the
retention of prominent lawyers for nominal services at a
fixed yearly fee. Except for this no attempt is made to
secure support in congress, and in all probability no
payment has ever been made or promised by an English
company in return for particular support for a definite
proposal. The great privileges which the railways enjoy,
especially in the matter of tariff, were granted in pursuit
of a declared policy of encouragement to railway enterprise&mdash;a
policy which no one there has reason to regret,
as without it the country would never have emerged from
its former lethargy.</p>

<p>With the exception of railway material, which for the
most part, comes in duty free, all manufactured articles
pay a very heavy duty indeed. But, whereas in almost
every other country of note, some portion at least of the
raw material is procurable locally, or at least from no great
distance, in the Argentine the most elementary of basic
materials have to be imported. With the exception of
wool, grain, cattle, a special quality of timber, and sugar,
there are no raw materials at all available for industrial
purposes. There are no minerals; cotton is a negligible
quantity at present; and fuel is as expensive as labour.
Coal does not exist (at least to a workable extent, if at
all); petroleum, though reported in parts of the
Cordillera, is non-existent for all practical purposes;
while wood is found in any quantity only in the forests
in the North, North East, in Entre Rios, and in parts of
<a name="Cordoba" id="Cordoba"></a>C&oacute;rdoba and San Luis. The expense of carrying this
to the capital would be prohibitive except by boat from
the riverine forests. And, in any case, the wood being
slow-growing and intensely hard, it would be manifestly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">-&nbsp;43&nbsp;-</a></span>
uneconomical to use anything but the trimmings as
firewood.</p>

<p>We have, then, a country with a highly protective
tariff compelled to import by far the greater part of its
fuel, which, though admitted free, is necessarily
burdened with freights prohibitive to economic industrial
development. The Argentine, indeed, may be said to
be placed, geographically, in the worst position possible
for such a purpose. Keeping, then, the question of fuel
in mind, the possible advantage (from the purely
economic point of view) must be examined of reducing
at home to the state of finished commodities the raw
materials mentioned above.</p>

<p>In every case of manufacture, the two obvious economic
reasons are either the ability to produce better or the
ability to produce cheaper. The former is out of the
question in the Argentine, because there is no hereditary
or traditional skill, nor special climatic conditions as in
Manchester; the latter, for the same reason, can only
be a question of freight. Any article to be consumed
at home, and produced mainly from native raw material
should, <i>prima facie</i>, be capable of production at home
for that consumption, granted an adequate supply of
labour. But, for export, general conditions being at
best only equal to those in the importing countries, the
only circumstances which could render home-manufacture
profitable would be greater liability to deterioration in
transit in the raw material than in the finished article,
or a great saving in bulk or weight in the latter.</p>

<p>Taking the raw materials, therefore, in the order given
above, the wool produced or procurable in Argentina is
greatly in excess of the present local requirements.
What skill there is in the country for spinning and
weaving is insignificant for practical purposes, the
articles produced being either extremely crude, or quite
exceptionally fine, and consequently expensive. Both
are the work of Indians, or half-castes&mdash;who are rapidly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">-&nbsp;44&nbsp;-</a></span>
becoming a smaller and smaller proportion of the total
population. Passing by as inconsiderable, therefore,
the advantage of home production on the score of special
skill, there remains the question of cheapness. For
some goods, special lines of purely local popularity,
which European houses would not make for other
customers, there are points in favour of local production.
But in such things as socks and articles of general
clothing, that command a universal market (with
differences only in design), it is found cheaper to
import. It must be added that there is comparatively
little demand for woollen goods at all in the Argentine
itself. Though the tariff, therefore, does not impose a
great burden on the people, from its protective aspect it
is encouraging an unprofitable industry.</p>

<p>The duties are as follows: On spun wool about 1&frac12;d.
per lb., valued at about 7d. per lb., on washed wool
1s. 7d. per lb., the customs valuation being 7d.; on
stockings and socks (all classes) about 50%, on woollen
cloth (pure) about 40%, and on wool and cotton mixed,
over 30%.</p>

<p>Passing over grain, the main manufactured product
of which, flour, is not imported at all, and cattle, which
in the frozen meat trade and its attendant industries
form one of the main items of export, there are left wood
and sugar. Of the former, the country produces little
for constructional and industrial purposes, all the natural
timber being employed either for railway sleepers, fencing
posts, or for tanning extract. It is an extremely
important business, but there could be no question of
importation, except for intermediate fencing bars (those
not planted in the ground) and for sleepers. Even so
the only circumstances which could render it possible
are the inability of the home supply to cope with the
demand, and the consequent rise in price. Recently
poplar has been planted on the islands of the Tigre near
the mouth of the Paran&aacute; with great success. But the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">-&nbsp;45&nbsp;-</a></span>
available space is limited there, though it is quite possible
that planting might be continued on the Paran&aacute; and
Uruguay rivers. The duty on imported soft woods is
comparatively small.</p>

<p><a name="sugar" id="sugar"></a>The one article of home-production left, which was
open to foreign competition, is sugar. The erratic
development of this industry in conjunction with the
tariff has been so eventful, and so instructive from the
economic point of view, that a rather lengthy review may
be pardoned. This is practically a paraphrase and
condensation of the extremely interesting, though, at
times, somewhat exclamatory article written by M.
Ricardo Pillado, the head of the Division of Commerce
in the Argentine Ministry of Agriculture, 1906. Unfortunately,
in attempting to follow some of the author&rsquo;s
calculations it has been found quite impossible to verify
his results or to see how he arrived at them. In some
cases the figures are so obviously impossible in the light
of the data that the only explanation seems to be a
misprint. In order not to sacrifice the continuity of his
account, these figures have been given as they stand.
The fact that the article in question appears in a
collection, derived from various sources, and republished
officially at the Ministry of Agriculture, seemed to give
additional justification for its presentation here without
emendation.</p>

<p>Writing at end of 1903, when the Brussels Convention
had just condemned Bounties, and when the original
heavy import duties and export drawbacks were still in
force, he makes this preface to a general discussion of
the whole working of the exaggerated protection of the
Sugar Industry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fiscal protection of the Sugar industry, instituted
in the year 1883, and maintained up to the present
moment in all its intensity, has been the source of the
gravest evils to the Republic, not merely through its
immediate effect and its having admitted and secured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">-&nbsp;46&nbsp;-</a></span>
the maintainance<!--original spelling--> of an economic system so detrimental
to the country, but also, in the sphere of credit, through
the complications of which it has been the indirect cause.
Every effort, therefore, tending to destroy to their very
foundations the fallacies which have been the mainspring
and origin of its birth and continuance up to the present
day ought to be considered, in my opinion, as an act of
patriotism and duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>M. Pillado is far from being a free-trader in the
accepted English sense. &ldquo;The protection which
reasonably may be and, I will even say, ought to be
afforded to national industries cannot,&rdquo; he goes on to
say, &ldquo;be identified with the favours which were lavished
on the sugar industry.&rdquo; Although he is in favour of a
moderate and strictly protective Tariff, he cannot reconcile
the prevailing system with any economic theory
whatever.</p>

<p>The Sugar plantations and refineries are situated in
the remote North West of the country, and the latter
were practically in the hands of two powerful concerns.
Owing to the expense of rail transport, under no circumstances
could the sugar be transported to the coast to
compete on equal terms with the imported ocean-borne
article, and certainly not, with the additional freight, in
European markets.</p>

<p>The initial error lay in the assumption that these
Northern Districts round Tucuman were especially
adapted by climate and other conditions to the cultivation
of cane. No such natural privilege exists. The origin
of the industry, on the contrary, is to be found in that
very distance from a port which renders its present
condition anomalous. Sugar-cultivation was instituted
solely with a view to the satisfaction of local requirements,
and the idea of competition with foreign produce in the
capital was probably never dreamed of. This view is
the more probable when it is remembered that Tucuman
lies nearly a thousand miles from Buenos Aires, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">-&nbsp;47&nbsp;-</a></span>
railway communication was not established until 1888
or even later.</p>

<p>At that time, however, protection was already in full
force. Although full communication was not established
until 1892, and till then goods had to be transported by
cartage, or whatever means the state of the roads (such
as they were) permitted, so early as 1883 the duty was
raised from the existing rate of 25% <i>ad volorem</i>, to a
specific tax of 5 cents per kilo, at a time when there was
only one currency. The impost being irrespective of
quality, the actual burdens resulted as follows: On
refined Sugar valued by the customs at 19 c. the kilo,
26&frac12;%; on white or granulated with a valuation of 14 c.,
35&frac34;%, on raw of 11&frac12; c. per kilo, 43&frac12;%. It is obvious
says the writer, that the greatest burden fell on the lower
grades, the only ones which the local refineries were in
a position to produce and to offer in competition with
imported sugars.</p>

<p>The year 1885 marked the next stage in the development.
Owing to facilities of transport being absent,
Tucuman was in no better position than before, while
the issue in the same year of the decree authorising a
paper currency with the consequent premium upon gold,
resulted in a natural increase in the restrictions on
importation. The increase in the duty was nominally
from 5 to 7 c. per kilo irrespective of quality. But the
actual increase resulted in a total of 90% on refined sugar
and 108% on the lower grades.</p>

<p>The third increase took place three years later, in 1888,
when the import charge was raised to 9 c. gold per kilo
on refined sugar, other qualities being taxed at the old
figure. On M. Pillado&rsquo;s estimate this meant a difference
of 268% between the cost of that sugar in bond and its
price to the importer.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"
href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"
href="#FNanchor_7_7">7.</a>&emsp;The
percentage seems to work out at 219, while the premium on
gold in that year (1888), as given in another official publication of 1906,
was in reality 150 roughly, which would mean 184%. But the absence
of reliable data makes an amateur result untrustworthy.</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">-&nbsp;48&nbsp;-</a></span>
The foregoing is a brief account of the course of
taxation introduced for purposes of protection as
described by M. Pillado. At this point he takes occasion
to moralise on the iniquity of the system, and exclaims
that it is a matter of congratulation that the promoters of
the industry did not think fit to produce even further
from the great centres, somewhere on the borders of
Bolivia. In emphasising these existing burdens, however,
the writer is merely making a dramatic pause
preparatory to enlarging on the further excess in the
institution of bounties on export.</p>

<p>The immediate result of this tariff was naturally an
immense rise in the price of all sugar, and subsequently
the practical exclusion of the imported article. The
figures cited in the work speak for themselves. In 1884
the total imports of sugar of all classes were 35,000 tons.
In 1902 they had fallen to 155 tons. While the next year
saw an importation of some hundred tons of refined
sugar, the other grades were represented by a total of
about 300 lbs.</p>

<p>We now come to the real interest of the question&mdash;the
effect namely which this policy had upon the industry
itself and the devices which the latter adopted to regulate
prices.</p>

<p>In the first instance an unparalleled boom took place.
In 1884 the production was 75,000 tons. In 1895 it was
109,000. In the following year the sum of 134,417
tons was reached&mdash;a production quite in excess of the
country&rsquo;s requirements. The result was that in the
words of M. Pillado, &ldquo;the refiners began to cry to
heaven and to earth for any solution whatever to rescue
them from the asphyxiation which threatened to overwhelm
at one and the same time themselves and their
system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the planters, however, Tucuman had become a
veritable Eldorado. Two years sufficed to give a net
return four times as great as the capital invested. As a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">-&nbsp;49&nbsp;-</a></span>
natural consequence it followed that labour and capital
flowed into the Sugar districts, creating an unprecedented
boom and denuding the other agricultural industries
not only of the province but of the rest of the republic as
well of their very necessities of existence. The effect
was felt, apparently even in the capital, so that &ldquo;lawyers
deserted their profession, workmen their tools, to throw
themselves with a regular fever into an occupation so
full of promise.&rdquo; Works sprang up as if by magic.
Palaces were constructed to house the staffs. Capital
was lavished on the industry by individuals and banking
houses alike. No one, in short, took the slightest pains
to investigate the stability of the trade, and investments
were made with complete recklessness.</p>

<p>While fortunes were being created in the cultivation of
sugar cane, orchards, orange-groves, pasturage, arable
land&mdash;everything else, in short&mdash;were being either transformed
or neglected, and the public generally was
compelled to pay an exorbitant price for its sugar. The
moment had, therefore, arrived for a reduction in
the import duties, and in the price of the article.
That, however, was not the view of the interested parties.
&ldquo;If,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;by any misfortune this year&rsquo;s harvest
should prove so good as the last&rdquo; a worse evil would
befall. Considering that private <a name="mortgages" id="mortgages"></a>mortgages amounted
to some five million dollars and that the total indebtedness
of the industry, in spite of its abnormal prosperity,
was no less than twenty million, the gravity of the
<a name="situation" id="situation"></a>situation was not exaggerated. A bad harvest would
be insufficient to satisfy the claims of creditors. A good
harvest would cause a tremendous fall in prices and
consequent disaster.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that there was formed in 1895 the
&ldquo;Union Azucavera,&rdquo; or Sugar Trust, with the avowed
object of taking over the entire production of all the
refineries and determining prices for home consumption
and export.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">-&nbsp;50&nbsp;-</a></span>
Unfortunately, however, for the success of the venture,
some concerns were not in the precarious state to which
the majority had been reduced. By dint of better
management and through other causes they still
succeeded in maintaining substantial returns. These
refused to enter the Trust&mdash;or Kartel more strictly&mdash;and
the result was a more or less complete failure.</p>

<p>Two combines were instituted, nevertheless, the above
mentioned &ldquo;Union&rdquo; (in a modified form, no doubt)
and a body known as the &ldquo;Centro Azucarevo.&rdquo; These
concerns devoted themselves with energy to the solution
of the problem of the surplus, and, as was to be expected,
the easiest seemed to be that supplied by political means,
the president of the &ldquo;Union&rdquo; being also president of
the Chamber of Deputies. So successful were their
efforts that in 1897 a bounty of 12 c. per kilo was
sanctioned, raised for the next year to 16 c. To pay for
this bounty an Inland Revenue tax of six cents paper per
kilo was declared on all sugar home or imported. As in
countries nearer home, the bounty system was an attempt,
a costly attempt, to market a commodity which in
normal circumstances was absolutely incapable of
meeting its competitors. Argentine sugar under the
most favourable conditions could not, and never was
expected to, compete in the open market with that of
other countries. In the circumstances it must be
admitted that the whole scheme was merely an organised
exploitation of the public in the interests of a weak
industry and certain speculative financiers. &ldquo;What
public interests,&rdquo; exclaims Mr. Pillado, &ldquo;what benefit
for the community could be cited to warrant a contribution
from the country at large of $40,000,000 in five years as
a gift to the exporters of sugar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of the $39,850,000 levied, $25,250,000 were given as a
free gift to the exporters, only $14,600,000 finding their
way into the exchequer.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
